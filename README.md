# the AWFixerOS Papers

so these papers are maintained by [AWFixer](https://app.gitbook.com/u/xCtBbULwe0TeldSOBHYcgL9ygv72 "mention") (definately not me) and in them i will be reporting on things that I have created myself so if it is not sourced, it is because i am the damn source - shut up already.

The tone of this will be very unprofessional as it is not my style to be super corporate and professional, im just a simple developer who likes breaking things, learning from what I broke, and building a better program. if you wanna learn more about me, one of these days I will make a personal website, for now check out my [github](https://github.com/awfixer) or [blog](https://hackertalks.blog/)
