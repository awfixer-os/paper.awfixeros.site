# Build Targets

what you will have to assign as build targets when you build applications:

#### ARM:

this is the primary platform we will be pushing as it is both powerful and power efficient and interops really well with the server hardware we plan on building in the future.

#### x86-64

This is the 'main" platform you will also need to fully support as it is the platform of traditional consumer hardware (at least at the time of writing this)

#### x86

This is a platform you will be required to support if you are producing graphical applications as we do not believe in junk computers.

#### PowerPC

This is a platform you will be required to support if you are producing graphical applications as we do not believe in junk computers.
